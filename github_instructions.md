# GitHub Deployment Instructions

I've prepared a complete archive of the Finance AI Assistant project for GitHub deployment. Here's how to push it to your GitHub repository:

## Steps to Deploy to GitHub

1. **Download the Archive**
   The project has been packaged as a tar archive. You'll need to download this archive from your Replit project.

2. **Extract the Archive**
   ```bash
   tar -xzvf finance-ai-assistant.tar.gz
   cd finance-ai-assistant
   ```

3. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Finance AI Assistant"
   ```

4. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository called "finance-ai-assistant"
   - Do not initialize it with README, .gitignore, or license files

5. **Connect to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/finance-ai-assistant.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
